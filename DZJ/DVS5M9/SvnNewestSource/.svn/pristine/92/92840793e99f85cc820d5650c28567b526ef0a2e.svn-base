# to find the obj stage file with "nostage%" to use at multi boot ${2} stage
# ${1} is the multi boot stage value, eg, 5
# ${2} is a "nostage%" obj file name, as "*.nostage+([0-9]).o",
# eg, myobj.nostage5.o
# result is the obj stage file name output to stdout,
# eg, <NULL string> or myobj.stage5.o
# \note when we want to build stage ${1} and to find a ${2} "nostage%" obj,
# if ${1} >= "nostage%", the stage obj ${2} of stage ${1} is what we need;
# if ${1} < "nostage%", the stage obj ${2} is ignored to build stage ${1}.

# \example if we have myobj.nostage5.o as ${2}
# % ${0} 5 myobj.nostage5.o  ---> will print "myobj.stage5.o" to stdout;
# % ${0} 3 myobj.nostage5.o  ---> will print nothing to stdout;
# % ${0} 8 myobj.nostage5.o  ---> will print "myobj.stage8.o" to stdout;
